# Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for the project.
All necessary documents can be found in [this](./) directory.
Additionally, jtcop uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the site, which is accessible [here](https://volodya.lombrozo.dev/jtcop/).

## Build Site Locally

To build the site locally, use the following command:

```bash
cd docs
jekyll build
```

Alternatively, you can use:

```bash
jekyll build -s docs
```
